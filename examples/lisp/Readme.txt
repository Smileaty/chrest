This folder contains some scripts using ABCL Lisp for building and manipulating
CHREST models.  The results are part of the standard results for CHREST, and
more details may be found in the referred publications.

This folder also contains some illustrative scripts, demonstrating 
further ways of using Chrest and the library.

1. The file 'classification.lisp' creates a model for a simple classification 
task, using the weather dataset.
2. The file 'demo-1.lisp' illustrates some of the different methods for 
creating and interacting with models.
3. 'chess-attention.lisp' reproduces a set of experiments comparing CHREST's 
attention mechanisms on chess positions with human players.
4. 'chess-presentation-time.lisp' reproduces a set of experiments comparing 
CHREST's recall ability against that of human players for a range of 
skill levels and presentation times.
